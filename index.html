        <h1>Central Universities</h1>
        <p>
            Central universities in India are public universities established by an Act of Parliament and are under the purview of the Department of Higher Education in the Ministry of Education, except for nine universities which are under the purview of other ministris.
            In general, universities in India are recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which draws its power from the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. In addition, 15 Professional Councils are established, controlling different
            aspects of accreditation and coordination. Central universities, in addition, are covered by the Central Universities Act, 2009, which regulates their purpose, powers, governance etc., and established 12 new universities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The region with the most central universities in India is Delhi with seven universities. There are central universities in all of the states of India except Goa. Of the union territories, there are central universities in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh
            and Puducherry.
        </p>

        <p>
            In August 2021, India's education minister Dharmendra Pradhan introduced a bill in the Parliament of India to amend the Central Universities Act, 2009 which will lead to a central university in the Union territory of Ladakh. Earlier in July, the Union
            Council of Ministers approved the setting up the new university for ₹750 crore. The new campus will come up at village Khalatse, located in between Leh and Kargil. As of August 2022, the university is still not operational.
